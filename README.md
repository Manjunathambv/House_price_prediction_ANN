House price prediction by using ANN 

House Median Price Prediction
Using Deep Neural Networks
Program Description
This program predicts if the price of a house will be above the median price or not based off of it's features.

About Neural NetworksÂ¶
Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems that are inspired by, but not necessarily identical to, the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. Deep Neural networs are just ANN's with multiple hidden layers.
